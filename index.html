        <h2>My Love for Video Games</h2>
        <p>
            Video games have always been a significant part of my life, providing both entertainment and a sense of adventure. Among my favorite games are:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Uncharted:</strong> The adventurous tales of Nathan Drake in search of hidden treasures are truly mesmerizing.</li>
            <li><strong>Phasmophobia:</strong> Exploring haunted locations with friends in this chilling cooperative game is an exhilarating experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Lethal Company:</strong> The action-packed gameplay and immersive storyline of this game always keep me on the edge of my seat.</li>
            <li><strong>Postals 4:</strong> Engaging in chaotic battles and completing missions in this game is both challenging and incredibly fun.</li>
            <li><strong>It Takes Two:</strong> The cooperative gameplay and unique storytelling in this game create an unforgettable gaming experience.</li>
